Developed an AI-powered *Mental Health Support Chatbot* leveraging *LangChain* and *Llama 3.3-70B (via LangChain Groq API)* for intelligent, context-aware responses. Implemented *ChromaDB* as a vector database for efficient semantic search and retrieval. Utilized *HuggingFace BGE embeddings* with *Sentence Transformers* to encode and index textual data. Integrated *PyPDFLoader* for document ingestion and *RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter* for optimized text chunking. Designed a *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline* to enhance response accuracy using *LLM-based query processing*. The system is scalable, real-time, and optimized for NLP-based interactions, ensuring efficient knowledge retrieval and context-aware mental health support.
